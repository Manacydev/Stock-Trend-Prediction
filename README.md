# Stock-Trend-Prediction
# Description
This project is an interactive Stock Trend Prediction application built using Streamlit for the frontend, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Networks using TensorFlow/Keras for time-series modeling, and pandas/matplotlib/NumPy for data processing and visualization.
The app allows users to input a stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, TSLA) and predict the future stock prices based on historical data (2010â€“2024).

# Technologies Used
Python (Core language),
Streamlit (Web Application Framework),
TensorFlow (Keras) (Deep Learning Framework),
NumPy, pandas (Data Manipulation),
Matplotlib (Visualization),
Stooq API (Data Fetching) and
Jupyter Notebook (Model Building).
# Features
User Input for Stock Ticker.

Visualization:

Closing price vs Time

Moving Averages (100 MA and 200 MA)

Predicted vs Actual Stock Price.

Training LSTM Model dynamically.
